# Login Console App
This is just a simple login system practice project I did to play with Python and JSON file handling in 
Python.

This console app lets a user register with their Full name and password and
saves the username (Full name + Last name) and hashed password in a JSON file.

Once the user is created, User is able to login and change their password in case they forgot.

The program has validation for Password and user login as well.
